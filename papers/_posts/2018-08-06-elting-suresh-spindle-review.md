# Abstract

The spindle segregates chromosomes at cell division, and its task is a
mechanical one. While we have a nearly complete list of spindle components,
how their molecular-scale mechanics give rise to cellular-scale spindle
architecture, mechanics, and function is not yet clear. Recent in vitro and
in vivo measurements bring new levels of molecular and physical control and
shed light on this question. Highlighting recent findings and open questions,
we introduce the molecular force generators of the spindle, and discuss how
they organize microtubules into diverse architectural modules and give rise
to the emergent mechanics of the mammalian spindle. Throughout, we
emphasize the breadth of space and time scales at play, and the feedback
between spindle architecture, dynamics, and mechanics that drives robust
function.
