# Abstract

Ripples are common in both biological systems and human clothes. Knitters have long exploited the ability of fabric to curl out of plane, by either removing or adding stitches to the material as it is created. Here, we present two knitting patterns for scarves to illustrate how ripples can arise through such additive processes.
