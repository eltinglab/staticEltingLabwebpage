We're so thrilled that our microscope has arrived in the Elting lab! So far it's just a bunch of crates so we're anxiously awaiting Monday morning when it will all be installed.

Hard to believe all of those giant boxes are going to fit on our little optical table! We can't wait to see it unpacked.
