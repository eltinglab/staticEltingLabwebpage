title: Preprint of Parsa's S. pombe spindle ablation paper on BioRxiv!
author: Mary Elting

We've posted a new preprint from undergraduate and now post-bac researcher <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/team/parsa-zareiesfandabdi/">Parsa Zareiesfandabadi</a>. Parsa has interrogated the collapse of the *S. pombe* spindle that follows laser ablation. Contrary to previous hypotheses, which implicated the nuclear envelope and/or chromosomes in this motion, Parsa found that it's microtubule dependent and that the molecular motor dynein is involved. You can read the paper <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.20.347922">here</a>.
