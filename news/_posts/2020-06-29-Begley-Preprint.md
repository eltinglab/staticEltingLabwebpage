title: Preprint of Marc's k-fiber bundle paper on BioRxiv!
author: Mary Elting

The Elting Lab's first preprint was posted on BioRxiv! You can read the paper <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.104661v2">here</a>. This project was a great team effort, led by graduate student <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/team/marc-begley/">Marc Begley</a>, and also including contributions from undergraduates <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/team/elizabeth-davis/">Elizabeth Davis</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/team/grant-sherrill/">Grant Sherrill</a>. Marc et al. ablated bundles of spindle microtubules called k-fibers that are responsible for attaching chromosomes to the mitotic spindle and ultimately for segregating them. This allows us to probe k-fiber mechanical cohesion and its molecular origin. In collaboration with Puck Ohi's group, we found that the kinesin-12 Kif15 is at least partially responsible for mechanically reinforcing k-fibers.
