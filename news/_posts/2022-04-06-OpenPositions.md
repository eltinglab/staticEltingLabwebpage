The Elting Lab has several currently open positions.

We are recruiting NCSU undergraduates for positions beginning in the Summer of 2022 (with the potential to continue into the school year). For full consideration for these paid positions, interested students should contact Dr. Elting by April 18. See instructions on the Join tab.

We are also recruiting one or more postdoctoral scholars to work on the mechanics of the mitotic spindle. Applicants should apply by April 18 to ensure full consideration, though applications will continue to be accepted until the position is filled. See more details on the Join tab.
