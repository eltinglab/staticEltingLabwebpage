We're very excited to announce our lab's first federal funding, from the National Science Foundation! This grant is an interdisciplinary, collaborative research intiative whose goal is to build synthetic cytoskeletons inside living cells. This project is a multidisciplinary program involving physicists, engineers, cellular biologists, theorists/modelers, and social scientists. In addition to the Elting Lab, we will be collaborating with the groups of <a href="https://www.bhamla.gatech.edu/">Saad Bhamla</a> (Georgia Tech), <a href="https://www.fredchanglab.ucsf.edu/">Fred Chang</a> (UCSF), <a href="https://sols.asu.edu/jane-maienschein">Jane Maienschein</a> (Arizona State University) and <a href="http://dinner-group.uchicago.edu/">Aaron Dinner</a> (University of Chicago). You can read more about the award <a href="https://sciences.ncsu.edu/news/team-led-by-nc-state-biophysicist-awarded-1-2-million-to-develop-cyborg-cells/">here</a>. We're also currently recruiting a postdoc and/or graduate students for this position. Find out more on the <a href="https://physics.ncsu.edu/eltinglab/page/join/">join page</a>!
