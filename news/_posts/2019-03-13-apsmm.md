<i>Last minute talk prep, somewhere between Philadelphia and Boston</i>

When Boston found itself under several inches of snow, Mary traveled for 12 hours in planes, trains, and automobiles to reach the American Physical Society March Meeting. (The travel, or at least the train part, was more fun than it sounds!) While there, she gave a talk on work in the lab from Marc Begley and Elizabeth Davis on "Probing the mechanical organization of k-fiber microtubule bundles within the mammalian mitotic spindle via targeted laser ablation and speckle microscopy."
