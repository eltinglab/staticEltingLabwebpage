<i>Elting Lab at the <a href="http://trianglecytoskeleton.com">Triangle Cytoskeleton Meeting</a>, Summer 2018</i>

The entire Elting lab had a great time participating in the Triangle Cytoskeleton Meeting on September 24, 2018. Mary was one of the invited speakers at the <a href="http://trianglecytoskeleton.com/pre-meeting-2018/">pre-meeting event</a> on Sunday night. Then on Monday, Ana Sofia and Parsa presented a poster on their work on the mechanics of the _S. pombe_ mitotic spindle, Mohamed presented his work on ablation of the cytokinetic contractile ring in _S. pombe_ (a collaboration with <a href="https://laplantelab.wordpress.ncsu.edu/">Caroline Laplante</a>), and Marc and Elizabeth presented their work on mammalian k-fiber mechanics. We learned a lot and had a great time at the fantastic venue of the Haw River Ballroom in Saxapahaw, NC!
