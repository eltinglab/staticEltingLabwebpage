Marc and Mohamed gave a shared NCSU Physics <a href="https://physics.sciences.ncsu.edu/events/category/cmb-seminar/">Complex Matter and Biophysics seminar</a> on their progress on "K-Fiber Dynamical Response to Molecular and Mechanical Perturbations" and "Laser Ablation to Probe Furrow Ingression Mechanisms in Schizosaccharomyces Pombe," respectively. Great job, Marc and Mohamed!
