The Elting Lab has received a five year, R35 Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (MIRA) grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the NIH. This grant will support our research on the mitotic spindle. We're very grateful to the NIH for the support, and are excited for the new science this will allow us to do. You can read more about the grant <a href="https://physics.sciences.ncsu.edu/2020/08/18/nc-state-physicist-awarded-1-8-million-for-research-on-cell-division/">here</a>. Also - we'll soon be hiring a postdoctoral researcher for this grant! So, if you're interested in the biophysics of the mitotic spindle and are searching for a postdoc opportunity, watch this space. More information coming soon.
