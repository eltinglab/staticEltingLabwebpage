It's been awhile since we've updated the blog. Summer is off to a great start with lots of exciting new data - and our lab has grown! We now have five lab members (though Ana Sofia is currently at an REU at the University of Chicago - congrats Ana Sofia!). Check out the [team page]({{ site.baseurl }}/team) to hear a little about all our new lab members.
