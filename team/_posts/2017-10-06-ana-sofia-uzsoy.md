Ana Sofia, an NCSU physics major and Park Scholar, joined as the first Elting Lab member in the fall of 2017.

The main focus of her work in the lab was to develop computational tools to track spindle length. Outside of the lab, she likes classical music and petting dogs.

After graduating from NCSU, she began a Masters in Machine Learning program at Cambridge University as a Churchill Scholar. Following the completion of her masters, she anticipates matriculating in the Harvard PhD program in Astrophysics.
