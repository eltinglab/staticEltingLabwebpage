I am an undergraduate at North Carolina State University majoring in biochemistry. I joined Dr. Eltingâ€™s lab in the summer of 2020. I have always been interested in how different fields of study work together to view problems in a novel way. This is not only why I joined a biophysics lab, but also why I chose biochemistry as my major. Outside of the lab I enjoy fishing, wood working, and spending time with friends and family.
